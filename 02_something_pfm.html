            <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-4">Understanding types of Investments in India</h2>
            <p>An investment is an asset aimed at growing wealth and protecting savings. The following are popular Indian investment options: -</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">1. Fixed Deposits</h3>
            <p>If you are someone who are just started investing, your first step should be to ensure that the money you are investing remains safe and grows steadily over time. The ideal way to do this is by investing in fixed income assets because they are safer and less volatile than other investment options. While there are many fixed - income investment options - the fixed deposit (FD) is probably the most popular of them all.</p>
            <p>The principal idea of an FD is to invest a fixed lump sum of money (called the principal) in a bank for a fixed period of time at a fixed rate of interest. Everything about this investment option is certain the principal, tenure and interest rate. At the end of the tenure, based on the instructions given by you, the bank will either renew the FD or pay you the principal along with the accrued interest.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Types of FD's: -</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Flexible Fixed Deposit Scheme:</strong> In such deposits, you can withdraw a part of the deposit before the maturity date. Unlike a traditional FD, which must be closed in full even if you need only a part of the money, flexible FDs allows you to withdraw only the amount that you need. The amount remaining in the deposit will continue to grow at the fixed rate. A few flexible FDs allows you to deposit money multiple times during a year. This ensures that the money in your savings account does not sit idle. Even the tenure of these deposits is flexible and can be set in view of your needs. There are various other options that these schemes offer depending on the bank.</li>
                <li><strong>Savings Plus Account:</strong> If you keep surplus cash in your savings account, you can ask the bank to move a certain amount from your savings account into an FD for a period of your choice or a period determined by the bank (usually 1 year). For eg., you could instruct the bank that you don't want to keep more than 10,000/- in your savings account. Based on this instruction, if the amount in your savings account is â‚¹15,000/-, the bank will move the surplus of â‚¹5,000/- into an FD for 6 months or for 1 year or for any period determined by you or the bank. This amount will earn a higher rate of interest then it would have if it were lying in your savings account. On maturity, you could either choose to renew the deposit or have the amount returned to your savings account. Your bank will execute all these transactions automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Deposit with Overdraft facility:</strong> In this type of FD, you can avail an overdraft facility on your savings or current account. For eg., if you have an FD of â‚¹1,00,000/-, the bank can transfer 75% - 80% of these deposits in your savings account on your request, and you can withdraw this amount. The FD will continue to earn interest on â‚¹1,00,000/-. You can repay the amount you have withdrawn in instalments, along with the specified interest, before expiry of the FD.</li>
                <li><strong>Post Office time deposits:</strong> The post office offers FDs with the tenures of 1,2,3 and 5 years to the holders of individual and joint accounts. Investment in 5 year time deposits are eligible for tax benefit U/s 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The interest offered is reviewed on the quarterly basis. In the first quarter of 2023-24 FY, the interest offered was 6.80% p.a., on 1 year deposits, 6.90% p.a., on 2 year deposits, 7% p.a., on 3 year deposits and 7.50% p.a., on 5 year deposits. Premature withdrawals are allowed with certain penalties. The minimum amount you can invest is â‚¹1,000/-. Additional investments must be in multiples of â‚¹100/-. There is no maximum limit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">2. Corporate and Government Bonds</h3>
            <p>Bonds are similar to the concept to Fixed Deposits. In the sense, that they are an investment option where you will end your money to an institution for a certain period and earn interest on it. The major difference is that when you invest in a bank, it is usually safe, and your investments are guaranteed up to a certain limit. By contrast, there is an element of risk associated with certain bonds. As compensation for the higher risk involved such bonds offer higher rates than those offered on bank Fixed Deposits. This is definitely an investment option that you could consider investing in. Lets take a quick look at how bonds work and how you can invest in them.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Bonds are issued by the government or a corporate entity, when they wish to borrow money for investors. In return, the investors will earn interest at a fixed or variable rate (also called the coupon rate) for a fixed period of time. In this way, bonds are similar to Fixed Deposits. However, unlike FDs bonds can be brought not only for short periods such a few months or years, but also for really long maturity periods for upto 40 years.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Some of the popular bonds issued by Government - owned entities are as follows: -</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Tax Savings Bonds:</strong> (U/s. 54 EC) - Investment in this section, bonds allow you to avail an exemption of upto â‚¹50,00,000/- in a financial year on the long term capital gains, that you have made from the sale of land or buildings (residential or commercial). These bonds have a lock-in period of 5 years and they earn you an interest of 5.25% p.a. Also, you cannot avail any loan or advance against this bonds and if you do so, the tax benefits will be reversed. To avail this benefit, you should make this investment within 6 months from the date of transfer of asset. For eg., if you have sold your home after a period of 3 years of acquiring it for a profit of â‚¹60,00,000/- you can invest upto â‚¹50,00,000/- of that amount in capital gain bonds to avoid paying long term capital gains tax on that amount. The bonds can only be used by certain public sector undertakings (PSUs), including the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) Ltd.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Free Bonds:</strong> - The interest earned on these bonds is exempt from Income Tax U/s. 10(15). These bonds usually have long tenures of 10,15,20 years or longer. The minimum investment amount in these bonds is â‚¹1,000/-, and usually, there is no maximum limit on the investment amount. Because of these two features, such bonds are favourite of high - net - worth individuals (HNIs). These bonds are traded on the stock exchange, although they may not be very easy to sell owing to the limited number of buyers. However, if you sell this bonds and make profit, the profit is taxable. Because there is no tax on the interest earned, TDS is not applicable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">3. Recurring Deposit (RD)</h3>
            <p>An RD is an investment option, that helps you accumulate a sizable corpus by investing small amounts at regular time periods for a fixed period. For some new investors, RDs can be important for another reason. It teaches them one of the most crucial lessons in investing: you can accumulate a significant amount of money by investing modest sums regularly over a long period. However, an RD has one drawback, that it shares with FD - it is not a very tax efficient investment option, especially if you are in higher tax brackets. Nonetheless, while other investment options may be more tax efficient, they may not necessarily offer a similar level of safety or liquidity.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Recurring Deposits at Banks and Post Offices:</strong> You can open an RD account with most banks and post offices. RDs with post offices have a fixed term of 5 years, where as bank offers multiple investment periods (min. of 6 months to a max. of 10 years). RDs with post offices offer a fixed rate of interest over the entire duration of 5 years, while banks pay different rate of interest depending on deposit period. Another difference is the penalty levied on premature closure, a post office will pay your money back with interest at the current, post office savings rate (which is as low as 4%) whereas most banks will usually, deduct a maximum of 1% from the RD rate offered.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">To sum if you are planning to build a decent savings corpus but don't have a large sum of money to invest in a FD or other, such investment options, you can start an RD.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">RDs are ideal for accumulating money to realize goals like creating an emergency fund, buying a vehicle, building a child's education fund, funding a family vacation, buying a favourite smart phone or any other gadget, and so on.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Tax Impact:</strong> Earlier, interest earned on RD was not subject to TDS. However, from 01/06/2015, similar to FDs, a bank will deduct Tax at Source, in your interest for a FY exceeds â‚¹40,000/- (or 50,000/- for Sr. Citizen) if you have not submitted your PAN details to your bank, and the interest you earned for your RDs is more than â‚¹40,000/- (or â‚¹50,000/- for Sr. Citizen), TDS will be applicable @20%. Once the TDS amount is deducted, you will not be able to claim a refund from the bank, even if you furnish your PAN details. You can claim it as a refund from the IT department while filing the ITR. If you are a Sr. Citizen you'll need to submit Form 15H to avoid TDS deduction. Other individuals will need to submit Form 15G.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">4. National Savings Scheme</h3>
            <p>The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a secure investment option provided by the Government of India through post offices. It offers reliable returns and significant tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, making it a popular choice among risk-averse investors.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a fixed-income investment scheme that you can open with any post office branch. This is an initiative by the Government of India and encourages subscribers mainly small to mid-income investors to invest while saving and also saving on income tax.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">You can invest in NSC from the nearest post office in your name, for a minor or with another adult as a joint account. NSC comes with a fixed maturity period of five years. There is no maximum limit on the purchase of NSCs.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Features of NSC</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Fixed income:</strong> Currently, the scheme is generating a guaranteed return at the rate of 7.7% for investors. The returns offered by NSC have generally been higher than FDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Types:</strong> The scheme originally had two types of certificates - NSC VIII Issue and NSC IX Issue. The government discontinued the NSC IX Issue in December 2015. So, only the NSC VIII Issue is open for subscription currently.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax savers:</strong> As a government-backed tax-saving scheme, you can claim up to 1.5 lakh under the provisions of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</li>
                <li><strong>Start small:</strong> You can invest as low as â‚¹1,000 (or multiples of â‚¹100) as an initial investment, and increase the amount when feasible.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest rate:</strong> Currently, the rate of interest is 7.7% p.a. for Q2 FY 2024-25, which the government revises every quarter. It gets compounded annually but will be payable at maturity.</li>
                <li><strong>Maturity period:</strong> The maturity period is five years.</li>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can purchase this scheme from any post office by submitting the necessary documents and undergoing the KYC verification process. Also, it is easy to transfer the certificate from one post office branch to another.</li>
                <li><strong>Loan Collateral:</strong> Banks and NBFCs accept NSC as collateral or security for secured loans. To do this, the concerned postmaster should put a transfer stamp on the certificate and transfer it to the bank.</li>
                <li><strong>Power of compounding:</strong> The interest you earn on your investment gets compounded and reinvested by default, though the returns do not beat inflation.</li>
                <li><strong>Nomination:</strong> The investor can nominate a family member (even a minor) so that they can inherit it in the unfortunate event of the investor's demise.</li>
                <li><strong>Corpus after maturity:</strong> Upon maturity, you will receive the entire maturity value. Since there is no TDS on NSC pay-outs, the subscriber should pay the applicable tax on it.</li>
                <li><strong>Premature withdrawal:</strong> Generally, one cannot exit the scheme early. However, they accept it in exceptional cases like the death of an investor or if there is a court order for it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Tax Impact:</strong> - While there is no upper limit on the amount that can be invested in NSC, only investments of up to 1.5 lakh a year can earn a subscriber a tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act of 1961. Furthermore, the interest earned on the certificates is also added back to the initial investment and qualify for a tax break as well. For the first four years, the interest gained on NSC is assumed to be reinvested (i.e. put back to the initial investment) and so eligible for a tax credit, subject to the overall annual limit of 1.5 lakh. The interest earned in the fifth year, however, is not re-invested and is thus taxed at the investor's applicable slab rate.</p>
        
            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">5. Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)</h3>
            <p>EPF is a government - mandated savings scheme that is available to all employees who earn a basic salary of upto â‚¹15,000/- per month. The EPFO came into existence on 15/11/1951. In 1995, the government introduced an additional scheme called the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) - a scheme that provides pension benefits to employees once they reach the age of 58 years. This facility is optional for employees who earn more than 15,000/- amount per month. Once you sign up for the EPF through your organization, 12% of your basic pay and dearness allowance (DA) is deducted every month and deposited into your EPF account. The rationale for having an EPF account is to ensure that employees mandatorily save some part of their salary for their retirement years.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF):</strong> - In addition to the mandatory 12% contribution to the EPF, you can also opt to contribute to a VPF. You may want to do this if you wish to take advantage of the EPF's 100%, guaranteed and tax-free returns. From FY 2021-22, the interest is tax free only on annual employee contribution of up to 2.5 Lakhs. As the name indicates, the VPF is a voluntary fund that is based solely, on the contribution of the Employee. With the VPF, you enjoy all the benefits of the EPF, including tax deduction under Sec. 80C, tax free interest for employee annual contribution of up to 2.5 Lakhs from the FY 2021-22) at the same rate as that of the EPF, and tax free withdrawal on maturity. With a VPF you can contribute a maximum of 100% of your basic salary and DA.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Points to consider before investing:</strong> The EPF scheme is mandatory for employees of almost all types of firms that employ more than 20 people. The employee can consider if they want to invest more than 12% that is required using the Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) route. The money can get locked in for a certain period of time and may not be available to you at a short notice.</p>
        
            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">6. Public Provident Fund (PPF)</h3>
            <p>Unlike EPF which is an investment option available to employed Indians. The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a similar option that is available to all Indian residents, irrespective of their employment status. The Government of India introduced the PPF scheme in 1968 to ensure that everyone could have savings for their old age.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">The key feature of PPF is its long maturity period; once you start investing in PPF, you must wait 15 years before you can withdraw the corpus. If you wish to continue enjoying its benefits, you can extend the scheme beyond 15 years in 5 years block, as many times as you want. Once you open the PPF account, you must invest a minimum of 500/- every financial year in your account while the maximum limit is â‚¹1,50,000/-. Although the 15 years lock in period might seem a turn off initially, it is necessary feature because time is a major factor in creating a meaningful amount for our retirement years. The fact that the amount received on maturity is entirely tax free makes it even more attractive.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">The interest rate of PPF is announced every quarter will apply to the investments made during the quarter, as well as the accumulated amount. You can close the PPF account prematurely, if it has been active for more than five years from the end of the year in which it was opened in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>To pay for the higher education of the account holder or children</li>
                <li>To pay for expenses related to treatment of a serious illness of the account holder, her spouse, dependent children or dependent parents</li>
                <li>In case the residential status of the account holder changes to non-residential Indian (NRI)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">In the case of such premature closure, a penalty of 1% is levied on all the interest earned during the preceding years.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Important advantages of PPF:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>The benefits under Sec. 80C reduce your tax liability by the amount you invest. For E.g., if you invest 50,000/- in a year, your taxable income will reduce by â‚¹50,000/-. The maximum amount you can invest is â‚¹150,000/- per year.</li>
                <li>There is no age limit for opening a PPF account. An account can be opened for even the youngest member of your family.</li>
                <li>You can make multiple deposits in a year.</li>
                <li>In a specified emergency, such as medical treatment or higher education, you can close the account and withdraw the amount after five years. Around 50% of your deposit can be withdrawn after five-year subject to specific condition.</li>
                <li>The entire amount is tax free after the maturity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">7. National Pension Scheme (NPS)</h3>
            <p>The National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a social security initiative by the Central Government. This pension programme is open to employees from the public, private and even the unorganised sectors, except those from the armed forces. The scheme encourages people to invest in a pension account at regular intervals during the course of their employment. After retirement, the subscribers can take out a certain percentage of the corpus. As an NPS account holder, you will receive the remaining amount as a monthly pension post your retirement.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Earlier, the NPS scheme covered only Central Government employees. Central Government employees joining on or after 01-01-2004 are mandatorily covered under the NPS. Now, however, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has made it open to all Indian citizens on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">The NPS scheme holds immense value for anyone who works in the private sector and requires a regular pension after retirement. The scheme is portable across jobs and locations, with tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 80CCD.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Benefits in investing in NPS: -</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Returns/ Interest:</strong> A portion of the NPS goes to equities (this may not offer guaranteed returns). However, it offers returns that are much higher than other traditional tax-saving investments like the PPF. This scheme has been in effect for over a decade, and so far has delivered 9% to 12% annualised returns. In NPS, you are also allowed the option to change your fund manager if you are not happy with the performance of the fund.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Currently, there is a cap in the range of 50% to 75% on equity exposure for the National Pension Scheme. For government employees, this cap is 50%. In the range prescribed, the equity portion will reduce by 2.5% each year beginning from the year in which the investor turns 50 years of age. However, for an investor of the age 60 years and above, the cap is fixed at 50%. This stabilizes the risk-return equation in the interest of investors, which means the corpus is somewhat safe from the equity market volatility. The earning potential of NPS is higher as compared to other fixed-income schemes.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulated:</strong> The PFRDA regulates NPS with transparent investment norms, regular performance reviews, and monitoring of fund managers by NPS Trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The NPS subscription is flexible. NPS subscribers can contribute to the NPS fund at any time in a financial year and change the number of subscriptions. They can choose their own investment options. They can operate their account online from anywhere and continue it even when they change their city and employment.</li>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">8. Gold as Investment</h3>
            <p>For centuries, gold has been a popular investment option across geographies and cultures, holding its value in good times and bad. Even now in spite of all the developments in the world of finance, gold continues to be the preferred choice of investors the moment there is a crisis on the horizon.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Buying gold is a matter of habit for many Indians. There are specific occasions where tradition requires us to buy gold, for e.g., festivals such as Dhanteras, Diwali, Akshaya Tritiya, birthdays, anniversaries, naming ceremonies, and weddings. Most of this gold is brought in the form of ornaments. The price of these ornaments not only includes the cost of gold but also charges for crafting ornaments (called Making Charges). At the times of selling these ornaments, however you only get the value of the gold back. The making charges are not returned to you. Therefore, if you treat gold ornaments as pure investment, you'll always end up with a loss because you will not get back the making charges at the time of selling. Remember, the more intricate the design, the higher are the making charges and greater is the loss when selling such ornaments.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Various ways for investing in Gold:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Physical Gold:</strong> Physical gold investment is basically holding gold in tangible form. You can buy gold jewellery and ornaments that will also be helpful on occasions and festivals. Alternatively, you can invest in gold coins and bars if you are buying with the sole purpose of investment. One of the major drawbacks of physical gold investment is that it proves to be costlier due to making, designing and labour charges. Also, there is a risk of theft due to which you might end up paying bank locker charges as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Gold:</strong> There are investment platforms that allow digital gold investment. When you invest your money in digital gold, the investment company buys an equivalent amount of gold on your behalf and stores it in secure vaults. The gold is insured by the insurance companies thereby saving you all the hassle of going to your jeweller or from the risk of theft and other charges.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Funds:</strong> - Also known as gold mutual funds, it's a gold investment plan that pool money from various investors and invest in various forms of gold. The fund tracks the prices of gold and offers the same gold investment returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds):</strong> It's akin to stock market investment but for gold. Gold ETFs trade on stock exchanges that provide you an opportunity to buy and sell gold, just like stocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Monetization Scheme:</strong> GOI introduced the Gold Monetization Scheme in 2015 whereby you can deposit physical gold with Bank and earn interest. The gold can be in any form, bars, coin or jewellery. When a customer brings in gold (jewellery) to the bank, it will first be tested for purity and after the consent of the customer, it will be melted. A certificate by the collection centre will be given stating the amount and purity of gold which will have to be produced in the bank for opening the gold deposit account. The quantity of gold will be credited into the customer's account. The interest earned on it will be exempt from income tax as well as capital gains tax. The minimum quantity of deposits is pegged at 10 grams to encourage even small deposits. The Interest is paid in INR. The Customer may redeem in cash or gold as per his choice.</li>
                <li><strong>Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs):</strong> - A sovereign gold bond (SGB) is a government security that is denominated in gold grams. It is a substitute for physical gold. Investors invest in these bonds when the scheme opens and it is redeemed on maturity. RBI on behalf of the GOI manages the sovereign gold bond scheme. Bank of Baroda offers customers the opportunity to invest in the sovereign gold bond scheme through all of its branches in the country.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Tax benefits on Gold Investment:</strong> Another reason as to why invest in gold is taxes. The government also promotes gold as an investment and thus, offers multiple tax benefits on gold investments. These include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax Exemption:</strong> If you hold gold for more than 3 years, gains from selling your gold investments are exempt from LTCG tax up to 1 lakh. Further, capital gains on sovereign gold bonds and gold monetization schemes are exempted.</li>
                <li><strong>Indexation Benefit:</strong> You can benefit from indexation to adjust the purchase price for inflation. This directly reduces your capital gains tax.</li>
                <li><strong>80C Deduction:</strong> Investing in Sovereign Gold Bonds provides you a deduction of up to 1.50 lakhs for each financial year.</li>
                <li><strong>Exempt Interest:</strong> Interest on the gold monetization scheme is exempted from tax.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">9. Stocks</h3>
            <p>Stocks are a type of security that gives stockholders a share of ownership in a company. Companies sell shares typically to gain additional money to grow the company. This is called the initial public offering (IPO). After the IPO, stockholders can resell shares on the stock market.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">A share is the smallest denomination of a company's stock. So each unit of stock is a share and each share of a stock is equal to a piece of the company's ownership. Suppose a person X owns 100 shares of ABC Inc. Now if ABC Inc., has 100,000 Shares, it means X owns 0.1% of the company. Any person or entity with 10% ownership in a company, regardless of how many shares they hold, is termed a principal stockholder.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">People who buy shares may earn interest on the money invested and dividends. But that is just part of their motivation to invest in a company. Another reason is that their investment in the company pushes up the company's value, which in turn increases its share prices. Shareholders can then sell these shares higher than their purchase price to make money on their investment.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Determining Stock prices:</strong> Stock prices are determined by the fundamental principles of supply and demand. When the number of buyers is greater than the number of sellers for the stock, its price will rise as demand outweighs supply. Conversely, the price will decrease due to an excess supply if more sellers than buyers exist. The market price is established when a buyer and a seller agree on a specific price, which then becomes the new market price for that stock.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Why do stock price change after hours or Over the weekend?</strong> Stock prices can fluctuate even when the regular trading hours have ended or during weekends due to various factors:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>After-hours trading:</strong> While less common, some investors engage in after-hours trading, which can lead to price volatility due to lower trading volumes and fewer participants.</li>
                <li><strong>Company announcements:</strong> Companies often release important news or financial reports outside regular trading hours, which can significantly impact investor sentiment and, consequently, the stock price.</li>
                <li><strong>Market psychology:</strong> Investor sentiment and market psychology play a role in price movements, even when the markets are closed. For instance, the "weekend effect" refers to the phenomenon where stock prices are lower on Mondays than the previous Friday's closing prices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>How stock prices determined in India?</strong> Determining stock prices begins with a company's initial public offering (IPO). During an IPO, a book-runner (a lead manager appointed by the company) sets the initial share price based on the perceived supply and demand for the stock. After the IPO, various factors can influence a company's share price:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Changes in the number of shares:</strong> An increase in the number of shares available in the market without a corresponding rise in demand can decrease the share price. Conversely, a smaller number of shares available can increase the share price if demand remains constant.</li>
                <li><strong>Company performance:</strong> Strong financial performance, positive industry news, or favourable changes in leadership can attract more investors, driving up demand and increasing the share price. Conversely, poor performance or negative news can decrease demand and share price.</li>
                <li><strong>Macroeconomic factors:</strong> Economic indicators, government policies, political stability, and global events can significantly impact investor sentiment and, consequently, the demand for a company's shares.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>How to invest in Stock?</strong> The first decision you need to make is whether you'd like to trade online or offline. If you have access to a computer with an internet connection, you can consider trading online. Irrespective of how you decide to trade, you'll have to open a Demat Account. The Demat Account holds the shares you own in demat (electronics) form. For trading online, alongwith a demat Account you'll need a bank account and a trading account (you can choose an online trading platform provided by your bank or choose from platforms such as icicidirect.com, sharekhan.com, zerodha.com, etc.) For offline trading, you'll have to talk to your broker over the phone or in person each time you wish to buy or sell a share. You will pay and receive money by cheque. You'll also have to open a brokerage account with your broker to deposit money for buying shares. The money you earn or need to pay the broker will be recorded in this account. To subscribe to IPOs, you can fill the relevant application form along with the BSBA form (Application Supported by Blocked Amount), which authorises the bank to block the amount pending allocation of shares, thereby avoiding the hassle of issuing refunds due to lower share allocations or no share allocations. With online trading you can apply for IPOs directly by using your trading account and net banking facilities. Whether you trade online or offline, you'll be charged a brokerage and other fees as follows:</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">10. Mutual Fund</h3>
            <p>Investors who desire to invest their funds in Corporate Securities lack information regarding profiles of companies. Such investors can invest their funds in corporate securities through mutual funds. The pooled funds are invested by expert portfolio managers. They help the client to invest in SIPs. Since mutual funds allow investment in numerous stocks, it enables investors to achieve broad diversification with an investment as low as â‚¹500/-. Unit Trust of India was the first mutual fund set up in 1964. The main objective of the UTI was to mobilize the savings of the household sector. A mutual fund can generate a capital gain for individual investor, since the price at which investors sell their shares can be higher than the price at which they purchased their shares. However, the price of the mutual fund's share may decline over time, which would result in a capital loss. The funds are managed by financial experts called fund managers. These professionals have the skills to analyse and make investment decisions. To manage the fund, the AMC charges a fee, known as the expense ratio. The gains generated from this fund investment are distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting applicable expenses, by calculating the Net Asset Value.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>How Do Mutual Funds Work?</strong></p>
            <p>A mutual fund pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities. Here's a step-by-step overview of how mutual funds work:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Pooling Money:</strong> Investors buy shares or units of the mutual fund, contributing their money to the fund. This collective pool of money is managed by professional fund managers.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Strategy:</strong> The fund manager uses the pooled money to buy a variety of assets according to the fund's investment objectives and strategy. For example, a stock fund might invest in a range of companies, while a bond fund might invest in various government or corporate bonds.</li>
                <li><strong>NAV Calculation:</strong> The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the value of one share or unit of the mutual fund. It is calculated by dividing the total value of the fund's assets minus any liabilities by the number of outstanding shares or units. NAV changes daily based on the performance of the fund's investments.</li>
                <li><strong>Value Changes:</strong> As the prices of the assets within the fund fluctuate, the NAV also changes. If the investments perform well, the NAV goes up; if they perform poorly, the NAV goes down.</li>
                <li><strong>Returns to Investors:</strong> Investors can earn returns through capital gains (when the fund sells investments at a profit) and income distributions (such as dividends or interest from the fund's holdings). These returns are typically reinvested or paid out to investors, depending on the fund's policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Buying and Selling:</strong> Investors can buy or redeem (sell) their mutual fund shares at the NAV price at the end of each trading day. This means the value you receive when you sell your shares is based on the NAV at that day's market close.</li>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Mutual funds charge fees for managing the investments. These fees can include management fees, administrative costs, and sometimes exit load. It's important to understand these fees as they can affect your overall returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Implications:</strong> Mutual fund returns are subject to capital gains tax (short-term and long-term capital gains). When the fund generates capital gains, those gains are distributed to investors, who then pay taxes on them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Ways and Modes of Mutual Fund Investment: -</strong> An investor can invest in mutual funds in the following ways:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Lump sum:</strong> When you want to invest a significant amount in a mutual fund in one go. For example, if you had a sum of 1 lakh to invest then you could go in for lump sum investment and invest the entire amount of â‚¹1.0 lakh at one go in a mutual fund of your choice. The units allotted to you will depend on the NAV of that fund on that particular day. If the NAV is â‚¹1000, you will end up getting 100 units of the mutual fund.</li>
                <li><strong>SIP:</strong> You also have the option to invest small amounts periodically. In the above example, say, you don't have 1 Lakh but can commit to an investment of â‚¹10,000 per month for 10 months, and you can align your investments with your cash flows. This way of investing is known as a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). SIP encourages regular investment of fixed amounts bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly and so on, depending on your need and the options available with the mutual fund.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Types of Mutual Fund Schemes:</strong></p>
            <p>As per the new classification implemented by SEBI from October 2017, a mutual fund can only have one scheme for each investment objective (except in the case of certain types of schemes like Index funds, ETFs, FoFs and Sectoral/ Thematic funds). Diversify your investment portfolio with various Mutual Funds. There's a diverse range of options out there, each tailored to specific investment goals, risk levels, asset classes and structures. Whether you're aiming for growth, income or specialised investments, Mutual Funds provide versatile avenues to building wealth.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF MUTUAL FUNDS</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds based on structure:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Open Ended Funds:</strong> An open ended mutual funds gives utmost liberty and flexibility to investor to enter and exit as and when they feel like. These funds are not traded in the open market. Transactions are performed directly through the fund.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed Ended Funds:</strong> Closed ended mutual funds offer a fixed timeline to investor for participating in and out of the fund. However, most of the close ended funds are listed on the exchange. They are launched through NFO for raising money and subsequently listed on an exchange.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interval Funds:</strong> Interval funds combine the features of open-ended and close ended funds. The units of an interval fund can be purchased and sold/ redeemed only during the interval specified by the fund house.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds based on Investment objective:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Debt funds:</strong> Debt funds invest in securities that generate fixed income, like treasury bills, corporate bonds, commercial papers, government securities, and many other money market instruments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equity funds:</strong> Equity funds concentrate their investments in equity shares. Equity funds can be categorized as Large cap fund, Mid-cap funds, Small Cap funds, Multi cap funds, Index funds, Sector Funds and Equity Linked Saving Schemes etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hybrid funds:</strong> Hybrid funds are a combination of equity and debt investments that are designed to meet the investment objective of the scheme. Each hybrid fund has a different combination of equity and debt targeted at different types of investors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds based on investment style:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Passive funds:</strong> Passively managed funds often just follow a market index. Buying and selling is also less frequent in passively managed funds. It mainly tracks the market returns. It has a low cost or free compared to actively managed funds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Active funds:</strong> An actively managed fund has an experienced manager and a management team to make investment decisions on the funds corpus. Buying and selling is done more frequently as it has a goal to outperform the market. But it has a comparatively higher fee or cost if compared to passively managed funds.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">11. National Savings Monthly Income Account Scheme (MIS)</h3>
            <p>MIS and Senior Citizens' Saving Scheme (SCSS) are similar in concept. SCSS, as the name suggests, is only for senior citizens, whereas MIS is for everyone. Both schemes aim to provide investors with a regular stream of income through the investment duration instead of offering a larger lump sum at maturity. When you invest in these schemes, you do so with the intention of receiving regular payments to manage your day-to-day expenses. Therefore, unlike the RD or NSC, where you get your investment alongwith interest at maturity, here, you receive interest every month and your investment amount at maturity. This is a crucial difference that must be considered when you plan your investment.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>How to Invest in MIS?</strong> You can open an account at any Post Office in India. Anyone who is 10 years of age, or older can open an account in their individual name. On successful account opening, you will receive a certificate mentioning your investment amount, your monthly income amount, and the maturity date. In addition, you will be provided a passbook to record the monthly amount you'll receive.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Highlights of the Scheme:</strong> The minimum investment is â‚¹1000/- or any sum in multiples of â‚¹1000/-. Until 31/03/2023, you could invest a maximum amount of â‚¹4.5 Lakhs in a single name and upto â‚¹9 Lakhs in a joint account. From 01/04/2023 the maximum investment limit is revised upwards to â‚¹9 Lakhs in single name and â‚¹15 Lakhs in a joint account. In case of a joint account, all holders will have an equal share. The scheme doesn't encourage premature withdrawal. You have an option to close the account, after the completion of 1 year and before the completion of 3 years. In such a case penalty on premature withdrawal will be levied.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Tax Impact:</strong> Investment in MIS do not offer any tax benefits. Although there is no tax deducted at source on the monthly interest you earn. It will be considered as income and taxed at an applicable slab rate. Sr. Citizens can claim a deduction U/s. 80 TTB, where interest income from all sources are exempt upto an amount of â‚¹50,000/- per year.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">12. Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)</h3>
            <p>The idea behind the SCSS is to help senior and retired citizens earn a regular income, income similar to the salary, by using their retirement funds. The Gol currently supports two income schemes: - The National Savings Monthly Income Account (MIS) and The Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS). The MIS scheme was launched before SCSS and it offers investors an assured fixed income every month. SCSS provides a higher return that those of other government savings schemes, such as MIS, NSCs and PPF. Similar to every other savings schemes the interest for SCSS is announced on a quarterly basis. The SCSS will earn you atleast 1% higher interest than the benchmark government bond rate. For July-September quarter of 2023, the government bond rate was 7.15%, whereas the SCSS offered investors a rate of 8.25% in that quarter. SCSS investments have a maturity period of 5 years. You can either withdraw your money at the end of 5 years or apply for an extension of another 3 years. SCSS provides seniors the flexibility to withdraw cash on an emergency basis. However, premature withdrawals attract a penalty. The minimum investment is â‚¹1000/-, you can make deposits in multiples of â‚¹1000/-. The maximum limit is 30 Lakhs.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Tax Impact:</strong> SCSS investment are eligible for tax deduction U/s. 80 C of the IT Act, 1961 upto 1.5 Lakhs.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-6">13. Real Estate</h3>
            <p>In 2023, the real estate sector showed resilience amid changing trends. Global economic recovery drove up demand for residential properties in India, thanks to low interest rates and a preference for smart living and luxurious ownerships. With India's status as one of the world's fastest-growing economies propelled by private spending and capital build-up, the real estate sector remains a top investment choice. Typically, Indian households allocate 77% of their assets to real estate as this asset class offers potential for high growth, strong returns, and secure income streams. Moreover, with SEBI's new directives on fractional ownership and small REITs, the sector is poised further for significant expansion in 2024.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">However, navigating the real estate market and choosing right investment outlets as per current government regulations and rates, can be daunting, especially for newcomers.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Diverse real estate investment options suitable for various investor profiles and risk appetites:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Rental Properties:</strong> The traditional approach involves acquiring residential properties for rental income. While straightforward, this method requires significant upfront capital and ongoing maintenance costs. Before investing, ensure the property is free of legal issues. Acquisition options include leasing, outright purchase, or financing through loans. Notably, there's a rising trend of investing in luxury rental properties, especially in major Indian urban centres such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. Industry data indicates that luxury residential real estate in these cities consistently surpasses other traditional assets, boasting an annual price growth of 4% to 7%.</li>
                <li><strong>Holiday Homes and House Flipping:</strong> Affluent buyers are expanding their property portfolios beyond primary residences to include lucrative second homes. In India, the demand for secondary residences has skyrocketed post-pandemic, reaching a staggering $1.394 billion by the close of 2021-an impressive 88.63% surge from pre-COVID levels. Combined with strategies like house flipping, where properties are renovated for increased resale value, Indians are capitalizing on their second homes by turning them into holiday retreats, drawing significant tourist interest.</li>
                <li><strong>REITs and ETFs:</strong> Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds provide indirect exposure to real estate by investing in related assets. Options include ETFs focused on real estate stocks, such as publicly traded builders, or those invested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITs function similarly to mutual funds by gathering investor capital to purchase income-producing assets. These assets generate rental income, which is then distributed to investors as dividends. Investing in REITs offers various benefits such as immediate liquidity, affordability, regulatory protection, tax advantages among others. With dividends constituting a significant portion of profits (90%), REITS provide a steady income stream, often tax-exempt.</li>
                <li><strong>Fractional ownership of Commercial Real Estate:</strong> This innovative approach involves multiple investors pooling funds to jointly purchase a commercial property. This reduces individual investment costs and risk exposure, while allowing shared rental income. Industry experts forecast significant growth in this segment with fractional ownership properties in India projected to reach $8.9 billion by 2025, growing annually at 10.5%. Commercial properties typically offer higher rental yields compared to residential options. A 25 lakh investment in fractional ownership could potentially generate 2 lakhs in annual rental income (calculated at 8-12 percent rental yield), coupled with at least 1.25 lakh in capital appreciation per year, contributing to wealth creation and improved monthly cash flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Types of risk in the Real Estate Investment:</strong> Understanding the various risks in real estate investments is crucial for effective risk management strategies.</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Financing Risk:</strong> Real estate investments often involve financing through mortgages or loans. Interest rate fluctuations, changes in lending policies, or difficulty in securing financing can pose financing risks. To mitigate this risk, investors should assess their financial capabilities, maintain a good credit profile, and consider various financing options to ensure flexibility and affordability.</li>
                <li><strong>Property specific risk:</strong> Each property has its unique risks, such as physical deterioration, environmental issues, zoning restrictions, or legal complications. Conducting thorough property inspections and researching the property's history can help mitigate property-specific risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Real estate investments are typically considered illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily converted to cash. The inability to sell a property quickly can lead to liquidity risk. Investors should consider their investment horizon and ensure they have sufficient reserves to cover unforeseen expenses or periods of low liquidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Market risk is a key concern in real estate investment, arising from potential declines in property values or income due to factors like economic downturns, oversupply, or demographic shifts. To manage this risk, investors should conduct thorough market research, diversify portfolios, monitor market indicators, and hedge against inflation.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Risk:</strong> Economic risk in real estate refers to the possibility of losing money or encountering cash flow issues. Factors like market downturns or difficulty in securing financing can lead to such risks. Mitigation strategies include thorough financial analysis, maintaining cash reserves, good credit, and ensuring the property generates adequate income.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Regulatory risk, often called legal risk, arises from changes in laws affecting real estate. These changes encompass zoning, environmental rules, taxes, and building codes, potentially impacting returns or property usability. To manage this risk, investors must stay informed, conduct thorough due diligence, and collaborate with experienced professionals familiar with local regulations.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Understanding Investment Risks Section -->
        <div class="section-card border-red-500 text-section">
            <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4">Understanding Investment Risks</h2>
            <p>As a general concept, the risk of any investment refers to the uncertainty associated with the expected returns. If the expected returns are guaranteed, there is no risk. For example, when an Indian investor invests in securities issued by the Government of India and holds the same till maturity, one is assured of getting the promised returns. This investment is considered to be risk-free.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">One may look at the risk from another angle. People invest their money to achieve financial goals. The risk they face is not having enough money at the required time, i.e., the time of the goal.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mt-6">Primary Risk in Investing</h3>
            <p>There are various factors affecting this risk. Primary among these are:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Price fluctuations:</strong> Prices of various securities fluctuate in the markets based on the opinions and actions of various buyers and sellers. The prices also fluctuate due to changes in the company, industry, or economy. When a short-term investor buys and sells securities, the price fluctuation can either result in a profit or a loss if the investor is able to make the right call. Or sometimes the same trade can result in a large loss if the investor's judgement about price movement goes wrong. For a long-term investor, the risk is reduced to some extent. The assets that exhibit higher volatility in the short term often have the potential to deliver high returns. At the same time, assets that are less volatile or not volatile at all offer poor returns. Volatility can be divided into two categories: security-specific and market-wide. The former can be reduced through diversification, whereas the latter cannot.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong> This risk refers to a borrower's inability to repay the borrowed amount as per the agreed schedule. The measure of credit risk is the credit rating, and the compensation for taking credit risk comes from a higher expected return, often referred to as the credit spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of illiquidity:</strong> The inability of an investor to sell the investments and convert them into cash could be due to various factors, primary among which is the inherent illiquidity associated with the investment. There are some assets and markets that have an inherent risk of illiquidity, while in certain cases, there are operational reasons. For example, the real estate market is inherently less liquid in that selling a property takes time, and there are phases in the market when the time taken could be years. At the same time, some mutual fund schemes may be highly liquid but may have a lock-in period for a certain duration.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Prices of items of consumption keep moving up over the years; this phenomenon is known as inflation, also called price inflation. Rising prices also mean a reduction in the purchasing power of the rupee. It impacts the well-being of a person when the investment returns are lower than inflation. Assets that do not take any of the above-mentioned risks often deliver lower returns than inflation, whereas in order to beat inflation, one must take at least one of the three risks, viz., price volatility, credit risk, or illiquidity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mt-6">Managing Investment Risk</h3>
            <p>Investments of any kind are subject to various risks. Even those investments considered risk-free expose the investor to a loss of purchasing power due to inflation. While an investor cannot completely do away with the risks, one can manage them in a manner to reduce the negative impact of those risks on one's investment portfolio.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">First and foremost, do thorough research about the investment and understand the risks. There is no substitute for that. If one is unable to do the research oneself, it would be prudent to seek professional help. The second step would be to diversify across different investment options. Diversification may be done across: Companies, Industries or Sectors, Asset Categories, Geographies or Currencies. Even within an asset category, it is important to diversify. A dual approach of high quality and diversification would generally safeguard one's portfolio against most risks. However, there are certain risks that cannot be diversified away, e.g., market-wide price volatility. When the entire market goes down, the individual securities within the market will also see price depreciation. The negative impact of such a risk may be avoided by matching the nature of the investment option with the investment horizon; e.g., it would be risky to invest in equity markets when the investment is for the short or medium term. At the same time, long-term portfolios must be protected from inflation. In such a case, a prudent approach would be to invest in securities that have the potential to beat inflation over the long term. At the same time, it would be wise to avoid highly volatile or even illiquid investments when the goal is near-term or short-term.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Types of Risk</strong></p>
            <p>Risk is usually understood as "exposure to a danger or hazard", however it is not exposure to danger, rather the variability in impact when exposed to a danger. In investment, risk is defined as the possibility that the actual earnings could be different from what is expected to be earned. In more technical terms, the dispersion around the average expected return is defined as risk.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">There are various types of risk viz., business risk, financial risk, liquidity risk, political risk, exchange rate risk etc.</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Business Risk:</strong> Variability of income flows caused by the nature of a firm's business, is defined as business risk. Sales volatility and operating leverage determines the level of business risk. For example, an auto manufacturer incurs high operating costs viz-a-viz a retail food company. Earnings and sales of the auto manufacturer fluctuates substantially over the business cycle leading to high business risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Risk:</strong> Financial risk relates to the means of financing assets debt or equity. It is uncertainty caused by the use of debt financing. When a firm borrows, it is required to make fixed payments that must be paid ahead of payments to stockholders. Thus, the use of debt increases uncertainty of stockholder income. and causes an increase in the stock's risk premium. This increase in uncertainty because of use of fixed cost of financing is referred as financial leverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Liquidity has multiple connotations in the realm of finance. One such connotation is the ease of converting an asset into an amount of cash, nearer to its economic worth. The more difficult the conversion, the more is the liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is the uncertainty introduced by the secondary market of an investment. Treasury bills have almost no liquidity risk. They can be sold in a fraction of minute at a price worth their economic value. On the other hand, a piece of art may take longer to get converted into cash and the price may deviate significantly from its worth.</li>
                <li><strong>Exchange rate risk:</strong> Exchange rate risk is the volatility of return introduced by acquiring investments denominated in a currency different from that of the investor. Changes in exchange rates affect the investors return when converting an investment back into the "home" currency. As more and more investors want to reap the benefits of a globally diversified portfolio, this risk increases. As an example, suppose that an Indian investor purchases a dollar denominated bond. On such bond, interest will be paid in dollar. If the rupee has appreciated in value compared to USD, when the interest is received in dollar and converted into rupee, the investor will receive less in rupee than expected. The risk in this entire episode is arising due to the unpredictability of volatile and uncontrollable currency exchange rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Risk:</strong> Political risk is the volatility of returns caused by the possibility of a major change in the political or economic environment in a country. Individuals who invest in countries that have unstable political-economic systems must include an additional country risk-premium when determining their required rate of return.</li>
                <li><strong>Geo-political Risk:</strong> Geopolitics is influence of geography and politics on the social and economic relationships between countries. Geopolitical risk is the risk associated with wars, terrorist acts, and tensions between states that affect the normal and peaceful course of international relations. An example of geopolitical risk could include a flare-up of tensions between China and USA and how it has impacted the global trade and economy. Another example is the border tensions between India and China that escalated in May 2020.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Regulatory risk is the risk associated with unpredictability about the regulatory framework pertaining to investments. It is the risk that existing regulations will become more stringent leading to higher transaction costs. Regulatory risk is higher in new investment opportunities and products than the matured and established ones.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Risk Tolerance Section -->
        <div class="section-card border-yellow-500 text-section">
            <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">Risk Tolerance</h2>
            <p>Risk tolerance refers to the amount of loss an investor is prepared to handle while making an investment decision. Several factors determine the level of risk an investor can afford to take. Knowing the risk tolerance level helps investors plan their entire portfolio and will drive how they invest. For example, if an individual's risk tolerance is low, investments will be made conservatively and will include more low-risk investments and less high-risk investments.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mt-6">Factors Influencing Risk Tolerance</h3>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Each investor will adopt a different time horizon based on their investment plans. Generally, more risk can be taken if there is more time. An individual who needs a certain sum of money at the end of fifteen years can take more risk than an individual who needs the same amount by the end of five years. It is due to the fact that the market has shown an upward trend over the years. However, there are constant lows in the short term.</li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Financial goals differ from individual to individual. To accumulate the highest amount of money possible is not the sole purpose of financial planning for many. The amount required to achieve certain goals is calculated, and an investment strategy to deliver such returns is usually pursued. Therefore, each individual will take on a different risk tolerance based on goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Usually, young individuals should be able to take more risks than older individuals. Young individuals have the capability to make more money working and have more time on their hands to handle market fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio Size:</strong> The larger the portfolio, the more tolerant to risk. An investor with a â‚¹50 Lakhs portfolio will be able to take more risk than an investor with a â‚¹5 Lakhs portfolio. If value drop, the percentage loss is much less in a larger portfolio when compared to a smaller portfolio.</li>
                <li><strong>Investor Comfort Level:</strong> Each investor handles risk differently. Some investors are naturally more comfortable with taking risks than others. On the contrary, market volatility can be extremely stressful for some investors. Risk tolerance is, therefore, directly related to how comfortable an investor is while taking risks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mt-6">Types of Risk Tolerance</h3>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> Aggressive risk investors are well versed with the market and take huge risks. Such types of investors are used to seeing large upward and downward movements in their portfolio. Aggressive investors are known to be wealthy, experienced, and usually have a broad portfolio. They prefer asset classes with a dynamic price movement, such as equities. Due to the amount of risk they take, they reap superior returns when the market is doing well and naturally face huge losses when the market performs poorly. However, they do not panic sell at times of crisis in the market as they are used to fluctuations on a daily basis.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Moderate risk investors are relatively less risk-tolerant when compared to aggressive risk investors. They take on some risk and usually set a percentage of losses they can handle. They balance their investments between risky and safe asset classes. With the moderate approach, they earn lesser than aggressive investors when the market does well but does not suffer huge losses when the market falls.</li>
                <li><strong>Conservative:</strong> Conservative investors take the least risk in the market. They do not indulge in risky investments at all and go for the options they feel are safest. They prioritize avoiding losses above making gains. The asset classes they invest in are limited to a few, such as FD and PPF, where their capital is protected.</li>

            <p>When evaluating investment opportunities, businesses must assess the potential risks and rewards associated with each option. Here are some key factors to consider:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Financial Viability:</strong> The financial viability of an investment opportunity is crucial. It involves analysing the potential return on investment (ROI), cash flow projections, and profitability. Businesses should consider factors such as the payback period, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR) to determine the financial attractiveness of the investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Market analysis:</strong> A thorough market analysis is essential to understand the demand, competition, and growth potential of the investment opportunity. Businesses should assess market trends, customer preferences, and competitive landscape to gauge the feasibility and potential success of the investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Every investment carries a certain level of risk. It is crucial to assess and manage these risks effectively. Businesses should consider factors such as market volatility, regulatory changes, operational risks, and financial risks when evaluating investment opportunities. Risk mitigation strategies should be developed to minimize potential negative impacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Fit:</strong> Investment opportunities should align with the overall strategic goals and objectives of the business. It is essential to evaluate how the investment fits into the existing business model and whether it supports the company's long-term growth strategy. Investments that complement existing operations and capabilities are more likely to succeed.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource allocation:</strong> Businesses should consider the resources required to pursue an investment opportunity. This includes financial resources, human capital, technology, and infrastructure. Assessing resource availability and allocation is crucial to ensure that the investment can be executed effectively.</li>
